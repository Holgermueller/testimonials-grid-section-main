## What I learned

This was the first time I've ever attempted to make a Mosaic Grid, with or without a framework. I found it challenging, but mainly time consuming, to set up the grid without having an array to loop through. Coloring the individual cards was difficult as well. I tried to dynamically style the cards, but I don't think I have the hang of it just yet. I tested my code by adding some extra cards, which I've deleted before deploying the site, and noticed the styles didn't carry over to these extra cards. Should I attempt to make a grid like this in the future, I might use a framework like Bootstrap.
